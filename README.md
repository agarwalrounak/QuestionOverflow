# QuestionOverflow
QuestionOverflow brings questions from Stack Overflow in real time to your terminal. 
All you need to do is provide the tags you are interested in and
QuestionOverflow will fetch the questions tagged with those tags continuously.

This is quite useful when you want to answer questions on Stack Overflow and 
feel cumbersome to continuously visit the Stack Overflow page. 

To begin, run `python index.py`
